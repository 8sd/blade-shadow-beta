										<h2>The application do not detect my gamepad</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Some gamepads are sometimes badly recognized on Linux. As a workaround, you can use <a href="https://www.vpn.net/" target="_blank">Hamachi</a> + <a href="https://www.virtualhere.com/" target="_blank">VirtualHere</a> to use any device on your Shadow seemlessly.
									</p>

									<hr />
									<h3>Explanations</h3>

									<p>
										<a href="https://www.virtualhere.com/" target="_blank">VirtualHere</a> will use the technology "USB Over IP" coded in the Linux Kernel to mount an USB device on the client computer whatever the OS. It was designed for a local network or, at least, a secured network. It uses the port 7575 and work really well in a local network.<br />
										Openning the port 7575 of your box to forward VirtualHere to the outside world is <b>very very very dangerous</b>. You litterally open your computer to anybody, and then can have a full access to your peripherals (like your webcam) or damage your computer. Please, do not do this.
									</p>
									<p>
										A way to bring Shadow inside your local network is to use <a href="https://www.vpn.net/" target="_blank">Hamachi</a>. It creates a private tunnel between every members of your network using the VPN technology. It's safe, it's pretty low latency and easy to use. Moreover, as you will be on a "local" (secured is more appropriated) network with your Shadow, you will be able to use VirtualHere.
									</p>

									<hr />
									<h3>Setup</h3>

									<p>
										Now, let's install it, shall we ? We will consider that the computer where the gamepad is plugged is a Linux. But keep in mind that you can for instance plug a device on your Raspberry Pi and forward this device to your Shadow asweel, it's magic ! We will also that the "client" will be a Shadow, so on Windows.
									</p>

									<p>
										First, we will install <b>VirtualHere</b>. On Linux, it is very straighforward as the Linux kernel already have this technology. Open a terminal, move where you want to put the one-file software and then, execute the following code:

<pre><code>wget http://www.virtualhere.com/sites/default/files/usbserver/vhusbdx86_64
chmod +x ./vhusbdx86_64
sudo ./vhusbdx86_64</code></pre>

										To run the service in the background, use the argument <code>-b</code> like follwing: <code>sudo ./vhusbdx86_64 -b</code>.
									</p>

									<p>
										Next, we will install <a href="https://www.vpn.net/" target="_blank">Hamachi</a> on your machine. I let you download the appropriate file for your distribution and architecture on this link: <a href="https://www.vpn.net/linux" target="_blank">https://www.vpn.net/linux</a> (for Arch users, <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/logmein-hamachi/" target="_blank">logmein-hamachi</a><sup>AUR</sup>).<br />
										Hamachi on Linux do not have a GUI, but you're not effraid right ? First let's configure Hamachi to allow your user to use it.
									</p>

									<p>
										<code>echo "Ipc.User $USER" | sudo tee -a /var/lib/logmein-hamachi/h2-engine-override.cfg</code>
									</p>

									<p>
										Then start the Hamachi service. This command depends on your distribution, I let you do this. Then, create an account on the official website of <a href="https://www.vpn.net/" target="_blank">Hamachi</a>. Then open a terminal, and let's configure Hamachi by doing <code>hamachi login && hamachi attach-net YOUR_EMAIL</code>. After this, go on the <a href="https://www.vpn.net/" target="_blank">Hamachi website</a> and accept the join request.
									</p>

										<span class="image"><img src="images/hamachi_virtualhere_linux.png" alt="" style="width: 40em;" /></span>
									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Start the Shadow</b>, we are close to the end. Download the <a href="https://www.virtualhere.com/usb_client_software" target="_blank">VirtualHere executable</a> and Hamachi on the <a href="https://www.vpn.net/" target="_blank">Hamachi website</a>.
									</p>

									<p>
										Install Hamachi first by following the steps. When the window is finally opened, log you in. The go on the <a href="https://www.vpn.net/" target="_blank">Hamachi website</a>, log you in and accept the request. Then create a network by clicking on "My network" and "Create a network". Choose a "mesh" architecture and name it whatever your want. When done, add your 2 computers, the Shadow and your PC, in the created network. You can now close your webbrowser but keep the Hamachi window open.
									</p>

									<p style="text-align: center;">
										<span class="image"><img src="images/hamachi_config.png" alt="" style="width: 30em;" /></span>
									</p>

									<p>
										Now start the VirtualHere executable, right click on the window, and select "Specify Hubs..." option. Click on "Add", then copy the Hamachi IPv4 of your computer via the Hamachi window. Click on "Okay" and back to the VirtualHere main window, you should see after loading a little + that show a tree of devices.
									</p>

									<p style="text-align: center;">
										<span class="image"><img src="images/hamachi_virtualhere.png" alt="" style="width: 30em;" /></span>
									</p>

									<p>
										Keep in mind that to use this system, both VirtualHere and Hamachi should be launched on every computer. With the free Hamachi account, you can add up to 5 computers on this network.

										<h2>The NVIDIA issue and workaround for Optimus</h2>
									</header>

									<p>
										The Shadow application on Linux uses the VA API (Video Acceleration API) which gives a set of tools to manipulate video streams. Recent NVIDIA graphics cards does not support VA API but use a proprietary codec called NVdecode (NVCuvid) and NVencode. More information about it over <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-video-codec-sdk" target="_blank">here</a>.
									</p>

									<p>
										The only way for the Shadow app to support NVIDIA graphics cards is to implement it directly in the code using these codec. It means for the user that we have to wait for an update from Blade itself.
									</p>

									<h3>The Optimus case</h3>

									<p>
										Optimus is a technology available on laptop where a NVIDIA and a Intel GPU are setup in the computer, working successively based on the workload. It gives a better power management for small tasks but provides the computing power stay high as for heavy tasks, the computer switches automatically to the NVIDIA GPU. So it means we can use Intel GPU instead of NVIDIA GPU if you have the sticker "NVIDIA Optimus".
									</p>

									<p>
										First things first, you need to install proprietary drivers. I let you find, based on your distribution (<a href="https://websiteforstudents.com/install-proprietary-nvidia-gpu-drivers-on-ubuntu-16-04-17-10-18-04/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA#Installation" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a>).
									</p>

									<p style="text-align: center;">
										<span class="image"><img src="images/nvidia_prime_profiles.png" alt="" style="width: 40em;" /></span>
									</p>

									<p>
										Now open the NVIDIA X Server Settings (an application available now in your app menu) and click on "Prime profiles". You can now choose the Intel GPU. It can take a while (3 min) when you change your GPU. When the confirmation window appears, log out and in again (or reboot to be sure). Now reopen the NVIDIA X Server Settings, and you should see less options, and in the Prime profiles, the Intel GPU should be selected.
									</p>

									<p>
										All you have to do now is to <a href="./#vainfo">configure your Intel GPU for the VA-API</a>.

									<header class="major">
										<h2>The application crashed when I try to strace (AppImage)</h2>
									</header>

									<p>
										The strace may crash the Shadow client with the AppImage. Indeed, strace disturbs the FUSE component of the AppImage used to mount it on your drive.<br />
										A workaround is to manually mount the AppImage, then start the strace on the shadow-wrapper.pl.
									</p>

									<p>
										First, mount the AppImage using the following command: <code>./shadowbeta-linux-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-mount</code>. You will get a path to a folder.
									</p>

									<p>
										From another terminal, go to this folder, and use the following command to start the strace:<br />
										<code>strace -f  ./shadow-wrapper.pl  &> /var/tmp/strace_shadowbeta && tar -zcvf ~/strace_shadowbeta.tar.gz /var/tmp/strace_shadowbeta && rm /var/tmp/strace_shadowbeta</code>
									</p>

									<p>
										Use your Shadow. When finished, close the launcher. Wait for the terminal to finish the process. When done, it should have created a archive in your user directory. This is what you should share.
									</p>

									<p>
										You may now close the first terminal to unmount the AppImage.
