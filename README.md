# Install Shadow Beta on Linux

This repository will gather a bunch of script to install and update Shadow Beta on several Linux Distributions.

Currently supported:
- Arch Linux

These scripts are designed by Shadow Discord community and have no link with Blade company.
Moreover, there is no guarantee that the scripts will work for you.

In the first place, please make all scripts executable: `chmod +x *.sh`.


# Arch Linux

For the first install, launch install-arch.sh script: `./install-arch.sh`. You will need the root rights.
For the next update, launch only update-arch.sh script: `./update-arch.sh`. You will also need the root rights.
